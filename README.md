# Cloud Advisor

This project is designed to fetch and analyze cost and usage data from AWS and Azure Cloud platforms. It uses APIs from both cloud providers to retrieve resource usage data (such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.) and then presents the data in a meaningful way. The project also includes scripts for managing and storing cloud cost and usage data.

## Features

- Fetches cost and usage data from AWS using AWS Cost Explorer API.
- Retrieves Azure cost and usage data using the Azure Cost Consumption API.
- Stores the data in a MySQL database for further analysis.
- Resolves conflicts and integrates AWS and Azure data.
- Provides a command-line interface for interacting with cloud resources.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- MySQL server (for storing the data)
- AWS account with appropriate permissions (for AWS Cost Explorer API)
- Azure account with appropriate permissions (for Azure Cost Consumption API)
- Dependencies (listed below)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VarshiniDandam/Cloud_Advisor.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required Python libraries.

```bash
cd Cloud_Advisor
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure AWS and Azure Credentials

You need to set up credentials for both AWS and Azure.

- **AWS**: Set up your AWS credentials using AWS CLI or directly in your code using the AWS SDK (`boto3`).
- **Azure**: Set up your Azure credentials to access the Azure Cost Consumption API.

### 4. Set Up MySQL Database

Ensure you have a MySQL server running and create the necessary databases and tables. You can find the table structure in the Python scripts where the data is being stored.

### 5. Run the Code

After everything is set up, you can run the Python scripts to fetch data:

```bash
python aws.py
python azure_usage.py
```

### 6. Push to GitHub

If you want to push changes back to GitHub, follow these steps:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

**Note**: If you encounter a `GH013` error, it means your commit contains secrets like API keys. Ensure that sensitive data is removed or use GitHub's Secret Scanning feature to unblock the push.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see merge conflicts, resolve them by editing the conflicting files and using `git add .` and `git commit`.
- Ensure your credentials are set up correctly for both AWS and Azure APIs.
- For any issues with the MySQL database, make sure your tables are correctly configured.
